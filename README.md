## Abstract

In past years, model-based techniques have successfully endowed aerial robots with impressive capabilities like high-speed navigation through unknown environments. However, task specifications, like goal positions, are often still hand-engineered.

To achieve true autonomy in applications such as disaster response and environmental-monitoring, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must additionally exhibit semantic understanding of tasks and environments, adaptation to unexpected changes, and robustness to unmodeled disturbances. Machine learning and deep learning have emerged as promising tools for higher-level autonomy, but are more difficult to analyze and implement in real-time.

Furthermore, maintaining high thrust-to-weight ratios for agility directly contradicts the need to carry sensor and computation resources, making hardware and software architecture equally crucial decisions.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers in the complementary fields of aerial robotics, learning, and systems to discuss the following themes: 
* Learning for flight - How should learning be incorporated into UAVs' perception-action loops?
* Structure in learning - How can models, structure, and priors enhance learning on UAVs? 
* Performance guarantees - How can we analyze closed-loop performance of learning-in-the-loop systems
* Software+hardware co-design - How can we implement learning algorithms on resource-constrained UAVs? How should we simultaneously optimize algorithms and hardware choices to create lightweight, but highly-capable, UAVs?

## Workshop Objectives

The objectives of this workshop are to:
* Discuss the aforementioned themes from the diverse perspectives of aerial robotics, learning, and systems researchers across academia, government, and industry
* Present state-of-the-art research results related to learning-in-the-loop for UAVs through keynote talks from leaders of related fields and contributed talks and posters
* Share details about, mistakes made, and "lessons learned" in hardware set-ups and software architectures that regular conference papers typically do not have space to expand on
* Stimulate and accelerate research in the learning for UAVs

## Invited Speakers

We will host invited speakers that give a broad view of the state-of-the-art. This will include academic faculty leading research groups that have demonstrated cutting-edge results in autonomous flight, as well as industry speakers on the commercial side and research side of UAV innovation. We believe this diversity will greatly benefit the workshop's audience.  

## Call for Papers

We will invite participants to submit extended abstracts to be presented at the workshop. More information to come!
